# GetHome - CSC404 Fall 2020
A mechanic wakes up from cryogenic sleep to discover that her ship is heavily damaged and the rest of her crew is nowhere to be found. 
Stranded deep in space with only a single robot boddy to help, the only option left is for her to make her way through the ship, unraveling 
the mystery of what happened through recordings left behind, and get to the source of it all -- the reactor core -- and fix it before it is too late.
